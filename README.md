An advanced networking + machine learning based system that captures network traffic, builds flow-level features, and detects anomalous or potentially malicious behavior in real time.
Designed as a BTech/IIT-level project combining packet analysis, behavior modeling, and ML-based anomaly detection.
Modern networks generate massive traffic where abnormal behavior (scans, floods, spikes, bot activity) is difficult to detect manually. This project builds an intelligent detection pipeline that:

Captures packets (live or from PCAP)

Converts packets into network flows

Extracts behavioral features

Learns normal traffic patterns

Flags anomalies using ML + rule engines

Displays results in a live dashboard
